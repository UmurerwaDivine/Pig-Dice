            <p>This is a simple dice game where two players have the chance to roll the dice to try and achieve a score of 100.</p>
            <p>The rules of the game are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When the player rolls the dice score is added to their turn total and they can continue to play.</li>
                <li>When a player rolls a 1, their total score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>When the player chooses to "hold"(pass their turn), their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>The player who first scores 100 or more points wins the game.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Try your luck!!!</p>
            As a user, I want to roll the dice when it's my turn to play in the game.
As a user, I want to see the score I get for each roll of the dice I make in the game.
As a user, I want to see my cumulative score for each round I play in the game. For example, if I roll the scores 2-6-3 consecutively, I should see my end score as 11.
As a user, I want the option to hold my score when I'm satisfied with the points I've gained in a round of playing. The game should, therefore, add my held score to my most recent cumulative score.
As a user, I want to be alerted when my dice rolls on number 1. This will help me know that I can't roll the dice until the alternate player takes their round.
As a user, I need a way to know which player has won the game, which means they have scored 100 points before the alternate player.
